/**
 * Pepe Racing Solution
 *
 * Strategy:
 * 1. Maintain a set of "active roots" - candidates for the current fastest pepe.
 *    Initially, partition all n^2 pepes into groups of n, race them, and the winners become the initial active roots.
 *    The losers of each race become "followers" of the winner.
 *
 * 2. To find the next fastest pepe:
 *    - If the number of active roots > n, perform reduction races. Take n roots, race them, keep the winner,
 *      and make the losers followers of the winner. Repeat until |active roots| <= n.
 *    - Once |active roots| <= n, run a "final" race with all active roots.
 *      PAD the race with followers to reach size n. Followers are safe padding because they are known
 *      to be slower than at least one current root (their leader).
 *    - The winner of this race is the global maximum. Output it.
 *
 * 3. Remove the global maximum from active roots and promote all its direct followers to be new active roots.
 *    These followers were beaten only by the pepe we just outputted, so one of them could be the next fastest.
 *
 * 4. Repeat until we have outputted n^2 - n + 1 pepes.
 *
 * Complexity: Roughly O(N^2) queries, well within limits.
